            2. Training data includes both **features (input)** and known **labels (prediction)**
            3. Predict numeric label values. Label is a numeric value with a range of possibilities
            4. Split dataset - Training dataset and validation dataset
            5. Linear regression algorithm
            6. Differences between the **predicted** and **actual** label values to calculate a metric that indicates how accurately the model predicted for the validation data.
            7. Evaluation metrics **(Lower the better)** - Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Co-efficient of determination (R^2). 
            8. Example: House price prediction, Car price prediction, Predicting sea level, Predicting no of vechicles that use a specific high way

            3. Binary and multiclass classification
            4. Confusion matrix - TP, FP, FN, TN

            3. In deep learning, what is the purpose of a loss function? - **To evaluate the aggregate difference between predicted and actual label values. Correct. A loss function determines the overall variance, or loss, between predicted and actual label values.**
            4. Deep learning: Approach where a computer program learns from a large amount of data. Starts by understanding simple patterns. With time, it learns to recognize complex patterns
            5. The loss function in deep learning is like this feedback - How far off is the current output of a model from the desired result? Goal of a deep learning system: Minimize the loss. In simple terms; The loss function is a score that tells us how well the AI is performing. A lower score ⇒ AI’s output is close to what we want. A high score ⇒ It’s far from the target. AI’s goal: Adjust and learn in a way that this score (loss) gets lower over time

            1. In mathematical terms, you'll often see the **features referred to using the shorthand variable name *x*,** and the **label referred to as *y***. Usually, an observation consists of multiple feature values, so ***x*** is actually a *vector* (an array with multiple values), like this: ***[x1,x2,x3,...]***.
        2. Training and validation dataset
